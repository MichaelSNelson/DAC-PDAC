# DAC

Fork of repository for the paper 'Discriminative Attribution from Counterfactuals'.

For installation instructions and additional resources to reproduce experimental results, see the corresponding [resource](https://dac-method.github.io).
This version has been modified to allow use of a Fast.ai ResNet classifier and can process RGB images using the residual, random, and INGRAD methods. Other methods of attribution are not currently working.
